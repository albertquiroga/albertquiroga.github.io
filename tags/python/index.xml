Although this is not unique to Swift (C# and JavaScript had it earlier), it&amp;rsquo;s the one I know most about since it&amp;rsquo;s iOS-related.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had to work with Python code for a very long time now, and the lack of a simple &amp;rsquo;extension&amp;rsquo; keyword is painful. Yes, this is not technically needed in Python as you can dynamically add attributes to classes at runtime, but it makes the process somewhat more cumbersome and way less intuitive.</description></item></channel></rss>
